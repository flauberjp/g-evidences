# my-git-usage-evidences

## github user for testing

This project has an [Github account](https://github.com/mygitusageevicencesapp) to support testing, for more information how to use it, please contact @flauberjp.

## Call for Action
Volunteers are welcome! If you would like to join the team, read instructions in [Be a volunteer](CONTRIBUTING.md) to check what is needed in order to start.

## How to use

1. [Download the _fat jar_ file from our 2st release](https://github.com/flauberjp/my-git-usage-evidences/releases/tag/1.1-SNAPSHOT)

2. Create a directory to store the files of this program
    * Create this directory _C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences_
      * If your OS language is not english, the path of _C:\Programa Files_ is different, 
      for instance, for brazilian portugues, it would be _c:\Arquivos de Programas_
    * Copy the _fat jar_ to this directory

3. Start the program
    * As administrador open the command 
    prompt at _C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences_
    * From that path, type the following command and hit _Enter_ key, what starts the program. 
    Command:
      > _my-git-usage-evidences-jar-with-dependencies_

4. Configure the program
    * On the program, enter your github 
    credentials (username and password)
    * Set the name of the repository on your github that is going 
    to be used to record your usage of git on non-github projects
    * Select the non-github git projects that you want to monitor 
    your git usage 
      * For that, select a folder which contains most of 
      you git projects, by clicking the button "_Selecionar_" and
      selecting the folder. That folder is going to be analyzed, 
      where in the end only the non-github git project folders
      are listed. **The analysis takes sometime, please wait**
      * Check the projects you want to monitor     

5. Apply the configuration
    * Click "_Aplicar configurações_" button, and wait the confirmation
    message indicating that everything was correctly configured

6. Testing the solution
    * Open one of yours git project where you just configured used this solution
    * Do any modification, then commit the modification, 
    then push it, what will trigger our solution
    * Access your github repo created on step 4. 
    ( defaul value is _my-git-usage-evidences-repo_ )
    * Check that the commit amount increased. 
    Repeat the operation to see this 
    number increase again. And with that your 
    [Github Contributions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile#contributions-calendar) 
    Calendar got marked, an evidence on Github that you just used git locally
