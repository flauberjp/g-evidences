# my-git-usage-evidences

## github user for testing

This project has an [Github account](https://github.com/mygitusageevicencesapp) to support testing, for more information how to use it, please contact @flauberjp.

## Call for Action
Volunteers are welcome! If you would like to join the team, read instructions in [Be a volunteer](CONTRIBUTING.md) to check what is needed in order to start.

## Using the solution, yet using few manuals steops

1. Generate the fat-jar
    * Use your IDE chosing package Maven Lifecycle or use the command line, running the following command in the root of the project: mvn package    
    * A file is generated at ./target/my-git-usage-evidences-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

2. Create a directory to store the files of this solution
    * Create the directory my-git-usage-evidences at C:\Program Files
    * Copy the file my-git-usage-evidences-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar to C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences

3. Create a project in your remote repository
    * As administrador open the command prompt at C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences, directory which was created in the previous step
    * From that path, run the this command: java -cp my-git-usage-evidences-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar io.github.flauberjp.forms.FormForTesting
    * On the form that shows up, enter your github cridentials (username and password), and click the button Validar Credenciais
    * With the validated credentials, click the Criar projeto no repo remoto button
    * Verify that your github repository and confirm that a repo named my-git-usage-evidences-repo was created (this name is customizable, it is just to edit the value of the text field Reposit√≥rio in the form, as example, let's assume you used the default value my-git-usage-evidences-repo)

4. Generate the file propriedades.txt
    * As adminstrator open the command prompt on directory C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences
    * On that path, run this command: java -cp my-git-usage-evidences-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar io.github.flauberjp.forms.FormForTesting
    * On the form that shows up, type yours github credentials (username and password), then clique Validar Credenciais button. 
    * With the validated credentials, click Salvar Dados em propriedades.txt button ( We are assume the repo name is the default one, my-git-usage-evidences-repo)
    * Confirm that arquivo propriedades.txt file was generated at C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences

5. Generate the hook
    * As administrator, open the command prompt, go to C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences
    * From that path, run this command: java -cp my-git-usage-evidences-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar io.github.flauberjp.forms.FormForTesting
    * In the form that shows up, click Gerar hook(arquivo pre-push) button
    * Confirm that pre-push file was generated at C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences

6. Use the solution
    * Pick one of your git projects (a git project is one that has a .git hidden folder on its roots)
    * Copy the file C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences\pre-push to yours .git\hooks git project

7. Testing the solution
    * Open one of yours git project where you just configured used this solution
    * Do any modification, then commit the modification, then push it, what will trigger our solution
    * Verify your github repo created on step "3. Create a project in your remote repository"
    * Assuming its name is the default one,  my-git-usage-evidences-repo, you can check that its commit was amount increased by one (repeat the operation to see this number increase again), and with that your [Github Contributions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile#contributions-calendar) Calendar got marked, an evidence on Github that you just used git locally
