# my-git-usage-evidences

## github user for testing

This project has an [Github account](https://github.com/mygitusageevicencesapp) to support testing, for more information how to use it, please contact @flauberjp.

## Call for Action
Volunteers are welcome! If you would like to join the team, read instructions in [Be a volunteer](CONTRIBUTING.md) to check what is needed in order to start.

## How to use

1. Generate the fat-jar
    * Use your IDE choosing package Maven Lifecycle or use 
    the command line, running the following command in the 
    root of the project, what will generate the jar file _./target/my-git-usage-evidences-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar_  
      > mvn package
      * You could skip this step, just [click download this .jar file from our 1st version](https://github.com/flauberjp/my-git-usage-evidences/releases/download/1.0-SNAPSHOT/my-git-usage-evidences-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar)

2. Create a directory to store the files of this solution
    * Create this directory _C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences_
    * Copy the jar file that directory

3. Create a project in your remote repository
    * As administrador open the command prompt at _C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences_
    * From that path, run this command: _java -cp my-git-usage-evidences-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar io.github.flauberjp.forms.FormForTesting_
    * This solution program starts, then enter your github credentials (username and password), and click the button "_Validar Credenciais_"
    * With the credentials validated, click the "_Criar projeto no repo remoto_" button
    * Access your Github and verify that it contains a repo named _my-git-usage-evidences-repo_. 
    Here we are assuming the value of the text field _Reposit√≥rio_ was not modified

4. Generate the file _propriedades.txt_
    * Back to the solution program, click "_Salvar Dados em propriedades.txt" button
    * Confirm that arquivo _propriedades.txt_ file was generated at _C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences_

5. Generate the hook
    * Back to the solution program, click "_Gerar hook(arquivo pre-push)_" button
    * Confirm that _pre-push_ file, which is the hook, was generated at _C:\Program Files\my-git-usage-evidences_

6. Apply the hook to a git project
    * Pick one of your git projects (a git project is a folder that has a .git hidden one on its roots)
    * Copy the hook to yours .git\hooks git project folder

7. Testing the solution
    * Open one of yours git project where you just configured used this solution
    * Do any modification, then commit the modification, then push it, what will trigger our solution
    * Access your github repo created on step 3. _my-git-usage-evidences-repo_
    * Check that the commit amount increased by one. Repeat the operation to see this 
    number increase again. And with that your 
    [Github Contributions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile#contributions-calendar) 
    Calendar got marked, an evidence on Github that you just used git locally
